Empowering Denoising Sequential Recommendation with Large Language Model Embeddings

First, obtain the source data from https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/index_2014.html

Second, use read_data.ipynb to preprocess the data, then run tointerest.py to obtain semantic embeddings

Third, run experiments using the baselines
